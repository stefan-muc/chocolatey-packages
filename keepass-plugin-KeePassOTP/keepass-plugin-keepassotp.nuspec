    <description><![CDATA[KeePassOTP allows you to generate one time passwords (OTP). It supports both standard TOTP and standard HOTP as well as Steam OTP and Yandex (Yandex.Key < 3).

Once set up, you can copy or auto-type the OTP. You may also create a QR code and scan it with an OTP app of your liking, e.g. andOTP, Google Authenticator etc.

Functionality provided:

- Drag&Drop QR codes to add OTP
- Auto-Type placeholder
- Configurable hotkey to invoke Auto-Type OTP
- Column to display OTP or to indicate possible 2FA usage
- Compatibility with Google Authenticator, andOTP etc.
- Support TOTP and HOTP as well as Steam OTP and Yandex (Yandex.Key < 3)
- Secure storage of OTP secrets
- Auto-Type or Copy OTP using the KeePass tray icon
- Indicate possible usage of OTP / two factor authentication (requires internet access)

Proprietary formats like Steam and Yandex.Key are supported as well.
Unfortunately Yandex changed their closed source algorithm starting with version 3. Due to lack of information, it's no longer possible to generate Yandex codes after installing / migrating to Yandex.Key version 3 or higher.
